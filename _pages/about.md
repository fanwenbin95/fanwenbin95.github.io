Hi! This is Wenbin FAN. I am a PhD student in Physical Chemistry @[Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn). 

My academic interests are classical quantum dynamics. 

- Path-integral molecular dynamics, also ring-polymer MD (RPMD)
- Reaction mechanism for atmospheric system
- Constructing potential energy surface (PES)

Now I am focusing on new field. 

- Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for water cluster
- Instanton description for tunneling
- Adiabetic reaction path

My hobby is music especially choral music.
